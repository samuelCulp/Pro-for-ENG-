        <h2>My Days at the Red Centre</h2>
        <p>
            You might be wondering what it's really like to live under Gilead's control. Well, let me tell you—it's a nightmare wrapped in silence. We spent our days in what used to be a gymnasium, but now it’s nothing more than a prison for minds and bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Aunts, as they like to call themselves, patrolled the halls with their electric cattle prods. Believe it or not, even they aren’t trusted with guns. Guns are reserved for the guards, known as Angels. I suppose they think we’re less dangerous this way—kept under watch, but never in direct contact with weapons. We’re only allowed outside twice a day, paired up, walking in circles around a barbed wire-enclosed football field.
        </p>
        <p>
            What does freedom even mean anymore? We weren’t allowed to speak freely, let alone leave the building. The Angels stood with their backs to us, watching over the fence, guarding the world from us—or was it the other way around? It's hard to tell these days.
        </p>
        <p>
            In those rare moments when the Aunts weren’t looking, we learned to communicate in whispers, the kind that barely make a sound. Sometimes, we'd stretch our hands across the space between us, reaching for human connection in a world that tried to strip it away. And when we were lying flat on our beds, we’d lip-read each other’s names, passing them down the line, as if naming ourselves made us real.

            Overhead, there’s this ceiling ornament in the shape of a wreath, but the middle is empty—plastered over, like they ripped out the center of it, or like an eye that’s been taken away. Once, there was probably a chandelier there, but now there’s nothing left to tie a rope to. They’ve made sure of that.

        <h2>The Room That Isn't Mine</h2>
        <p>
            There’s this ceiling above me—white, clean, and sterile. Right in the middle, there’s a relief ornament shaped like a wreath, but the center is blank, plastered over. It reminds me of an empty eye socket, a place where something was violently taken away. Once, there must have been a chandelier, but they've removed it. Just like they've removed anything you could tie a rope to.
        </p>
        <p>
            The door to this room—which I refuse to call mine—doesn’t even lock. It doesn't shut properly either. They don't care if I stay inside because there's nowhere to run. The rug on the floor is made of braided rags, something you’d see in an old-fashioned home. It’s the kind of thing they love here—folk art. “Traditional values,” they’d say. Waste not, want not.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think about that phrase a lot: <em>waste not, want not</em>. What does it mean for me? They say I'm not being wasted, but then, why do I still want? I have another name, you know. Not "Offred." Something else. But no one uses it anymore. It’s forbidden. I tell myself that it doesn't matter, that a name is like a telephone number, useful only to others. But deep down, it does matter. I keep my real name hidden, buried like treasure. One day, maybe, I’ll come back and dig it up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do all the Handmaids have the same room? The same print on the wall, the same stiff chair, the same lifeless white curtains? I wonder sometimes. <em>Government issue</em>, as Aunt Lydia would say. The window only opens partway, and the glass is shatterproof. It’s not about keeping us from running away. They know we wouldn’t get far. It’s about preventing those other escapes—the kind you make within yourself, with a sharp edge.
        </p>
        <p>
            But here I am, sitting in this chair, in the sunlight, surrounded by flowers. And I remind myself: <strong>I am alive. I live. I breathe.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything we Handmaids wear is red. Blood red. It defines us, stains us. Even the wings we wear on our heads keep us from seeing—and from being seen. I’ve never looked good in red. It’s not my color.
